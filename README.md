# Hecate Entity System Framework

## What is it?
Hecate is an Entity System framework for games, written in C++, to manage
entities in a game world, and is heavily based upon Artemis Entity System
Framework. Artemis (thus Hecate) is inspired by "Entity Systems are the Future
of MMORPG" articles by Adam Martin on t-machine.org. Ideas were also borrowed
from Ted Brown who implemented a simple high-performance Entity System in
Processing.

## What does Hecate mean?
Hecate, in Greek mythology, is the cousin of Artemis. Thus, I feel it's a
fitting name for a C++ version of a Java framework.
